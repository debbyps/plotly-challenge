Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

The purpose of this interactive dashboard is to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The dashboard consists of a dropdown for each test subject ID.  There are three sections: Demographic Info, Top Ten OTU's by ID and Frequency of OTU's by ID.  Upon launch, the dashboard will auto populate with the details pertaining to the first test subject.  On selection of the drop down, the dashboard will refresh for the corresponding test subject.

The app.js has commented code which describes what each different section is doing.  The most challenging piece of this this was getting the demographics data to populate and getting the initial initiation to display the first test specimen data.
